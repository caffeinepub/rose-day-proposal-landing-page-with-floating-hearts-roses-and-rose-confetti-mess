  "summary": "The diff updates the background animation to deterministically render both hearts and roses concurrently, with configurable per-type counts and increased overall density (App passes 25 hearts + 25 roses). However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the canvas remains non-interactive (e.g., pointer-events disabled) or that it is explicitly layered behind hero content via styling/z-index within the background component.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "The animation remains layered behind the page content (hero text, buttons, overlays) and does not obscure readability.",
      "reason": "While App renders the background before the main content and main has `z-10`, the diff summary does not show any CSS/className/inline styles on the canvas/container to guarantee the background is behind all content (e.g., fixed positioning + lower z-index). The FloatingHeartsRosesBackground file is truncated before any JSX/styling is shown.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "The animation remains non-interactive (does not block clicking or scrolling).",
      "reason": "No evidence in the diff summary that the canvas has `pointer-events: none` (or equivalent) to ensure it does not intercept clicks/scrolling. The relevant JSX/styling portion of the component is not shown due to truncation.",
